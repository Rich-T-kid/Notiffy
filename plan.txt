Start out by defining what interfaces this project is going to need
Interfaces should rely on other interfaces no actuall implementations

Email (yahoo,gmail,ect)
number(ios,andr,ect)
calls(??)
Timed notifcations
Rety methods
What is going to be the storage method for this info? (structured:sql or unstructured:mongoDB)
Focus of this project is to make sure that non coding things arent a pain in the back like last time
(docker, env varibles, venv files, non static IP addresses, connection issues) <- these should all be resolved at the start so we can focus on implementation and not configs
try and get this done by wed night


KEEP MAIN BRANCH CLEAN AFTER THIS COMMIT
